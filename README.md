<h1>ES410: Project Brief â€“ Group 5</h1>
Low-Cost Smart Agricultural Sensing System for Small Holder Farms in South Asia

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The aim of this project is to design a low-cost smart agricultural sensing system for small-scale farms in South Asia, specifically focused on rice crops. The system will include sensors that can measure the nitrogen levels in the soil, as well as a radio frequency transceiver that can transmit this data to a central hub for processing. This data will be displayed on a graphical user interface (GUI) using data analysis techniques, providing the farmer with valuable information about the health of their soil. Machine learning models will also be used to predict future soil health, which will also be displayed on the GUI.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
The main objectives of the project are:
	
* Research different options for sensors that can measure nitrogen levels in soil
* Research different microcontrollers, displays, and machine learning models that can be used in the central hub
* Design a printed circuit board (PCB) that can integrate the sensors, microcontrollers, RF transceiver, and power source
* Design a GUI that can take user input and clearly display data
* Develop methods for analyzing sensor data and use machine learning techniques to identify patterns and predict soil health
* Test the integrated system and provide a proof of concept of the design
<h2>Stretch Goals</h2>

* Construct a fully-working prototype of the system
* Connect the system to Wi-Fi to receive external data, such as weather data, for improved machine learning
* Gather data from multiple sensors (e.g. temperature, humidity, moisture levels) and build an online database to store information from multiple sensor hubs.
